## references
[1] Full document of the 'Senate Code of Practice onThe Assessment of Students' can be found on [web.anglia.ac.uk](https://web.anglia.ac.uk/anet/academic/assess/index.phtml). The markdown table above examples the letter 'o' being used to indicate the degree of progress. This Guntt chart can be used for self and peer assessment as well as by the cohort leader to monitor students' progress. It acts as a visual representation, a summery of progress documented in the logbook.
